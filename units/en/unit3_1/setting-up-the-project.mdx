# Setting up the Project

In this section, we'll set up the development environment for our Pull Request Agent. 

<Tip>

We'll use modern Python tooling with `uv` for dependency management and create the necessary configuration files. If you're not familiar with `uv`, you can learn more about it [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

</Tip>


## Project Structure

Let's start by creating the project directory and understanding the file structure:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/mcp-course/tag-this-repo
```

Our final project structure will look like this:

```
hf-pr-agent/
├── mcp_server.py              # Core MCP server with tagging tools
├── app.py                     # FastAPI webhook listener and agent
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
├── pyproject.toml             # Project configuration
├── env.example                # Environment variables template
├── cleanup.py                 # Development utility
```

## Dependencies and Configuration

Let's walk through the dependencies and configuration for our project. 

### 1. Python Project Configuration

We will use `uv` to create the `pyproject.toml` file to define our project:

<Tip>

If you don't have `uv` installed, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

</Tip>

```toml
[project]
name = "mcp-course-unit3-example"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "FastAPI and Gradio app for Hugging Face Hub discussion webhooks"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.104.0",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0",
    "gradio>=4.0.0",
    "huggingface-hub[mcp]>=0.32.0",
    "pydantic>=2.0.0",
    "python-multipart>=0.0.6",
    "requests>=2.31.0",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
    "fastmcp>=2.0.0",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src"]
```

For compatibility with various deployment platforms, the same is repeated in `requirements.txt`

To create a virtual environment, run:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate # or .venv/Scripts/activate on Windows
```

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create `env.example` to document required environment variables:

```bash
# Hugging Face API Token (required)
# Get from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
HF_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here

# Webhook Secret (required for production)
# Use a strong, random string
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here

# Model for the agent (optional)
HF_MODEL=owner/model

# Provider for MCP agent (optional)
HF_PROVIDER=huggingface
```

You will need to get your Hugging Face API token from [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

You will also need to generate a webhook secret. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

You will then need to add the webhook secret to your `.env` file based on the `env.example` file.

## Next Steps

With our project structure and environment set up, we're ready to:

1. **Create the MCP Server** - Implement the core tagging functionality
2. **Build the Webhook Listener** - Handle incoming discussion events
3. **Integrate the Agent** - Connect MCP tools with webhook processing
4. **Test and Deploy** - Validate functionality and deploy to Spaces

In the next section, we'll dive into creating our MCP server that will handle all the Hugging Face Hub interactions.

<Tip>

Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control. The `.env` file should be added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of secrets.
